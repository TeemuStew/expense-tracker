# Expense Tracker - Overview

## Purpose
This project aims to simplify personal finance management by providing a clear overview of spending habits. Users can track expenses by category, review monthly summaries, and get quick insights through charts.

## Motivation
I built this project to explore frontend and backend development using **React** and **Node.js** and to showcase skills in building RESTful applications with clean UI/UX. I focused on responsive design, smooth interactions, and data visualization.
